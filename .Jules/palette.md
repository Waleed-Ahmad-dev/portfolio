## 2026-01-02 - Elevating Focus with focus-within
**Learning:** Default focus rings on small internal elements (like card links) often feel disconnected from the larger component context.
**Action:** Use `focus-within` on the parent container (card) to mirror hover styles. This gives keyboard users the same "card elevation" experience as mouse users, making the interface feel more tangible and responsive.
